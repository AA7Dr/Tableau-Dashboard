## Context:
This data source provides a limited view of the overall gaming and console market,  it includes a small selection of games per year (ranging from 4 to 15 titles). As a result, the observed decline in sales may not accurately reflect the industry's actual performance but could instead be a consequence of incomplete data. The lack of broader representation may skew trends and misrepresent the true state of the gaming market.
Given these limitations, please keep this in mind when interpreting the dashboards and their takeaways. The insights presented should be viewed with caution, consider them more as a reflection of my current skill set rather than definitive conclusions.
